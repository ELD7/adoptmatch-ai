# AdoptMatch: AI for Responsible Animal Adoptions

## Summary  
AdoptMatch is a project that uses artificial intelligence to match adopters with shelter animals in a more conscious and compatible way.  
The goal is to improve the quality of adoptions and reduce the number of animals returned to shelters.  
The system analyzes preferences, habits, and behavioral characteristics to suggest the most suitable animal.

## 1. Your idea in a few words  
AdoptMatch is an AI-based system that matches people interested in adopting animals with dogs and cats available in shelters, based on preferences, lifestyle, and behavioral compatibility.

## 2. Background  
Every year, thousands of companion animals end up in shelters or are returned after an unsuitable adoption. This often happens due to **poor compatibility** between the adopter and the animal.  
The idea came from my love for animals and the belief that adoption is an important act that should be made consciously.

## 3. Data and AI techniques  
The system collects:  
- Data about the **animals** (age, size, energy level, compatibility with other animals or children, habits)  
- Data about the **users** (living space, work schedule, experience with animals, preferences)

The AI (a neural network or recommendation algorithm) evaluates the compatibility between the user and the animal to suggest the **ideal adoption**. It can also predict the **risk of return**.

## 4. How it is used today  
Some platforms show animal profiles, but none use AI to **personalize** the selection.  
AdoptMatch aims to fill this gap, improving adoption quality and reducing returns.

## 5. Challenges  
- Getting real and complete data from shelters (requires collaboration)  
- Ethics: ensuring the AI doesn’t discriminate or exclude valid options  
- Matching reliability: avoiding "false positives" (bad matches)

## 6. What’s next  
AdoptMatch could evolve into a **network of connected shelters**, support **international adoptions**, or integrate with veterinary apps and tracking systems.
